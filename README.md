## A simple Prestashop module to be used for label printing with Zebra printers.

<br>
It's made for Zebra ZD220 but can be used with other Zebra printers if modified.
It has to be uploaded to Prestashop as a zip file, while maintaining the folder structure:

```
zebraprintsimple/
|-- zebraprintsimple.php
|-- config.xml
|-- js/
|   |-- label_preview.js
|-- views/
|    |-- templates/
|        |-- admin/
|            |-- product_button.tpl
```
